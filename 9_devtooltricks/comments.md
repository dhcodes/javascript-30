# Comments for Javascript30, Lesson 9: 14 Must-Know Dev Tool Tricks

There were some great console tricks here. I'd seen `console.table(arr)` used before but always forget to use it.

Key Takeaways:
- `console.time('string')` and `console.timeEnd('string')` can be used to test performance
- string interpolation can be used to print JS variables to the console (ex. `console.log(`${variable}`)`)
- `console.assert(test)` will allow you to write a test case. If the test is false, it will throw an assertion error. This makes for easier testing in the browser.
