# Comments for Javascript30, Lesson 12: Key Sequence Detection

This was a fun little activity. Wes and I ended up going about parts of it in different ways because I do the challenge before watching the solution, but both results worked.

Things to remember:
* `.splice()` can limit an array's length to the keyphrase length.
* When comparing arrays, it can help to convert one to a string.
* Keyboard cat is still cool.
