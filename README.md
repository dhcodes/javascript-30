# Javascript 30

This repo will store my projects that are part of [Wes Bos' Javascript 30 series](https://javascript30.com/). I plan to attempt each project on my own and then watch his tutorial videos to compare my code to his recommendations. I'll leave thoughts/comments in the Notes files linked below.
