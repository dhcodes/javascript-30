# Javascript 30

This repo will store my projects that are part of [Wes Bos' Javascript 30 series](https://javascript30.com/). I plan to attempt each project on my own and then watch his tutorial videos to compare my code to his recommendations. I'll leave thoughts/comments in the Notes files linked below.

### Finished projects
- [JS Drumset](http://codepen.io/dhcodes/full/rWZOrz) | Notes
- [CSS+JS Clock](http://codepen.io/dhcodes/full/QGVZxJ/) | Notes
