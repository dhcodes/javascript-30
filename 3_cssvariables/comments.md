# Comments for Javascript30, Lesson 3: Manipulating CSS Variables with JS

I had not learned about the adoption of variables into CSS until beginning this project. It was nice to be exposed to something new that was surprisingly easy to implement. Wes and I approached this the same way for the most part, though I wrote more functions than I needed to and need to refactor my code to make it reusable. In other words, I did not adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. I used some different functionality than Wes did to make the project a little more useful and wrote a handy function to allow the photo source to be able to be manipulated as well. And it worked the first time to boot!

Key takeaways:
- Use ES6 string interpolation
- Follow DRY
- Use :root instead of `html` for CSS variables
- Read up on the `setProperty` feature of JS
