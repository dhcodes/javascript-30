# Comments for Javascript30, Lesson 11: Custom HTML5 Video Player

It was nice to go to some D3 and React and come back to vanilla JS and still be able to complete this in a reasonable amount of time. I'm also glad my math worked out :).

Things to remember:
* Use `.querySelectorAll()` more often.
* Use data attributes more often.
* I could have added an event listener to both sliders with one function
* Get comfortable using `&&` to conditionally run a function.
