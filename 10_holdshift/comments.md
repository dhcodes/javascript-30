# Comments for Javascript30, Lesson 10: Hold Shift to Select Multiple Inputs

This one took me longer than I think it should but it was a good learning experience. The way Wes approached it by adding an in-between variable that changed based on what other boxes were checked is slightly more streamlined than my approach but we were similar on many fronts (ex. using lastChecked and `this`).
