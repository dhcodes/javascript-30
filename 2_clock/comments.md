# Comments for Javascript30, Lesson 2: CSS + JS Clock

I thought this would be a lot harder than it was but it actually went pretty quickly. A few differences include:
- Wes used transform-origin with a percentage whereas I used `left`.
- Wes added a cubic bezier `transition-timing-function` to give it a realistic tick.
- Wes used an ES6 template literal to insert the degrees variable into the javascript selector instead of string interpolation.

Our approaches to the JS were quite similar so that's reassuring.

Main takeaways:
- learn more about ES6 template strings (literals)
- it's easier to use `.getSeconds()` etc. to get the seconds instead of doing the math conversion.
