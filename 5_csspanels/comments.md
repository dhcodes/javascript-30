# Comments for Javascript30, Lesson 5: CSS Panels

My approach was different, but I think both results are similar. Wes' used flexbox whereas mine used generic CSS width. I do like the flexbox approach. I had also not realized that the events were actually `click` events so mine are `mouseenter`. We both used toggle functions to add a couple of classes that provided the text effect.

Take-aways:
- One way to visualize flex-items is to add a border to all children of the flex-parent
- Use `querySelectorAll` as an alternative to `document.getElementsByClassName`
- `transitionend` is an alternative event to listen for.
