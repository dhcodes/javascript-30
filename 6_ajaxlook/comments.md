# Comments for Javascript30, Lesson 6: AJAX Look-ahead

This one took me longer than I care to admit but I learned a lot along the way  (including the Web API fetch command) and got a lot of practice using `.map` and regular expressions. At one point, I was stuck for way too long trying to use the Regex method `.replace` when `.match` was the one I needed. I hoped that Wes would've showed how he made the folded paper effect but I suspect he was using [Oridomi](http://oridomi.com/).

Key Take-aways:
- Get the data (ex. using console.log), then worry about attaching it to the DOM.
- Use more function snippets.
- Use the spread operation (`...`) to push the results of a nested array into a new array.
- `.map` can be used to return html elements that can then be joined and attached to the `innerHTML` of an element to manipulate the DOM.
